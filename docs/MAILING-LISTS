There are currently three mailing lists related to nmh:

nmh-announce@mhost.com
----------------------
This is a very low-traffic mailing list for announcing new releases,
patches, and important events related to nmh. 

nmh-bugs@mhost.com
------------------
This an open-submission list for reporting bugs.  It is moderated to
prevent being spammed.  Any nmh-related mail is approved.

nmh-workers@mhost.com
---------------------
This is the main list for discussing work on nmh.  Both of the above
mailing lists are forwarded to this one.  There is currently no 
nmh-users mailing list, so user questions are acceptable here (the
comp.mail.mh newsgroup is another good option).


mail archives
-------------
The mail archives are only available to people subscribed to the
mailing list.  This restriction is in place to prevent harvesting of
email addresses by spammers.  To access the archives, you need to send
mail to nmh-workers-request with an archive access command.  You can
get a current list of commands the archive server understands by
sending a message to nmh-workers-request@mhost.com with the subject
"archive help". 

Of interest in the archive are the directories "latest" which contains
everything since the nmh-workers mailing list has been hosted on
mhost.com, and "old-list" which contians all the mail from when the
list was formerly hosted at math.gatech.edu.
