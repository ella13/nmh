.SH NAME
mh-profile \- user profile customization for nmh message handler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I $HOME/.mh\(ruprofile
.SH DESCRIPTION
Each user of
.B nmh
is expected to have a file named
.I \&.mh\(ruprofile
in his or her home directory.  This file contains
a set of user parameters used by some or all of the
.B nmh
family of programs.  Each entry in the file is of the format
.PP
.RS 5
.IR profile\-component ": " value
.RE
.PP
If the text of profile entry is long, you may extend it across several
real lines by indenting the continuation lines with leading spaces or tabs.

.SS "Standard Profile Entries"
The possible profile components are exemplified below.  The only mandatory
entry is `Path:'.  The others are optional; some have default values if
they are not present.  In the notation used below, (profile, default)
indicates whether the information is kept in the user's
.B nmh
profile or
.B nmh
context, and indicates what the default value is.
.PP
.BR Path :

only mandatory profile entry.  (profile, no default)

.BR Previous\-Sequence :
.I pseq
.RS 5
Names the sequence or sequences which should be defined as the `msgs' or
`msg' argument given to any
.B nmh
command.  If not present or empty,
no such sequences are defined.  Otherwise, for each name given, the
sequence is first zero'd and then each message is added to the sequence.
Read the
.BR mh\-sequence (5)
man page for the details about this sequence. (profile, no default)
.RE
.PP
.BR Sequence\-Negation :
not
.RS 5
Defines the string which, when prefixed to a sequence name, negates
that sequence.  Hence, \*(lqnotseen\*(rq means all those messages that
are not a member of the sequence \*(lqseen\*(rq.  Read the
.BR mh\-sequence (5)
man page for the details.  (profile, no default)
.RE
.PP
.BR Unseen\-Sequence :
unseen
.RS 5
Names the sequence or sequences which should be defined as those
messages which are unread.  The commands
.BR inc ,
.BR rcvstore ,
.BR mhshow ,
and
.B show
will add or remove messages from these
sequences when they are incorporated or read.  If not present or
empty, no such sequences are defined.  Otherwise, each message is
added to, or removed from, each sequence name given.  Read the
.BR mh\-sequence (5)
man page for the details about this sequence.

local nicknames for hosts are not replaced with their official site names.
For each address, if a host is not given, then that address on any host is
considered to be you.  In addition, an asterisk (`*') may appear at either

.SS "Environment Variables"
The operation of
.B nmh
and its commands it also controlled by the
presence of certain environment variables.
.PP
Many of these environment variables are used internally by the
\*(lqWhat now?\*(rq interface.  It's amazing all the information
that has to get passed via environment variables to make the
\*(lqWhat now?\*(rq interface look squeaky clean to the
.B nmh
user, isn't it?  The reason for all this is that the
.B nmh
user
can select
.B any
program as the
.IR whatnowproc ,
including
one of the standard shells.  As a result, it's not possible to pass
information via an argument list. The convention is that environment
variables whose names are all upper-case are user-settable; those
whose names are lower-case only are used internally by nmh and should
not generally be set by the user.
.PP
If the
.B WHATNOW
option was set during
.B nmh
configuration, and
if this environment variable is set, then if the commands
.BR refile\ ,
.BR send ,
.BR show ,
or
.B whom
are not given any `msgs'
arguments, then they will default to using the file indicated by
.BR mh\-draft (5).
This is useful for getting the default behavior
supplied by the default
.IR whatnowproc .
.PP
.B $MH
.RS 5
With this environment variable, you can specify a profile
other than
.I \&.mh\(ruprofile
to be read by the
.B nmh
programs
that you invoke.  If the value of
.B $MH
is not absolute, (i.e., does
not begin with a \*(lq/\*(rq), it will be presumed to start from the current
working directory.  This is one of the very few exceptions in
.B nmh
where non-absolute pathnames are not considered relative to the user's
.B nmh
directory.
.RE
.PP
.B $MHCONTEXT
.RS 5
With this environment variable, you can specify a
context other than the normal context file (as specified in
the
.B nmh
profile).  As always, unless the value of
.B $MHCONTEXT
is absolute, it will be presumed to start from your
.B nmh
directory.
.RE
.PP
.B $MM_CHARSET
.RS 5
With this environment variable, you can specify
the native character set you are using.  You must be able to display
this character set on your terminal.
.PP
This variable is checked to see if a RFC-2047 header field should be
decoded (in
.BR inc ,
.BR scan ,
.BR mhl ).
This variable is
checked by
.B show
to see if the
.I showproc
or
.I showmimeproc
should
be called, since showmimeproc will be called if a text message uses
a character set that doesn't match
.BR $MM_CHARSET .
This variable is
checked by
.B mhshow
for matches against the charset parameter
of text contents to decide it the text content can be displayed
without modifications to your terminal.  This variable is checked by
.B mhbuild
to decide what character set to specify in the charset
parameter of text contents containing 8\-bit characters.
.PP
When decoding text in such an alternate character set,
.B nmh
must be able to determine which characters are alphabetic, which
are control characters, etc.  For many operating systems, this
will require enabling the support for locales (such as setting
the environment variable
.B $LC_CTYPE
to iso_8859_1).

.SH HISTORY
The
.I \&.mh\(ruprofile
contains only static information, which
.B nmh
programs will
.B NOT
update.  Changes in context are made to the
.I context
file kept in the users
.B nmh
directory.
This includes, but is not limited to: the \*(lqCurrent\-Folder\*(rq entry
and all private sequence information.  Public sequence information is
kept in each folder in the file determined by the \*(lqmh\-sequences\*(rq
profile entry (default is
.IR \&.mh\(rusequences ).
.PP
The
.I \&.mh\(ruprofile
may override the path of the
.I context
file, by specifying a \*(lqcontext\*(rq entry (this must be in
lower-case).  If the entry is not absolute (does not start with a
\*(lq/\*(rq), then it is interpreted relative to the user's
.B nmh
directory.  As a result, you can actually have more than one set of
private sequences by using different context files.

.SH BUGS
The shell quoting conventions are not available in the
.IR \&.mh\(ruprofile .
Each token is separated by whitespace.
.PP
There is some question as to what kind of arguments should be placed
in the profile as options.  In order to provide a clear answer, recall
command line semantics of all
.B nmh
programs: conflicting switches
(e.g.
.B \-header
and
.BR \-noheader )
may occur more than one time on the
command line, with the last switch taking effect.  Other arguments, such
as message sequences, filenames and folders, are always remembered on
the invocation line and are not superseded by following arguments of
the same type.  Hence, it is safe to place only switches (and their
arguments) in the profile.
.PP
If one finds that an
.B nmh
program is being invoked again and again
with the same arguments, and those arguments aren't switches, then there
are a few possible solutions to this problem.  The first is to create a
(soft) link in your
.I $HOME/bin
directory to the
.B nmh
program
of your choice.  By giving this link a different name, you can create
a new entry in your profile and use an alternate set of defaults for
the
.B nmh
command.  Similarly, you could create a small shell script
which called the
.B nmh
program of your choice with an alternate set
of invocation line switches (using links and an alternate profile entry
is preferable to this solution).
.PP
Finally, the
.B csh
user could create an alias for the command of the form:
.PP
.RS 5
alias cmd 'cmd arg1 arg2 ...'
.RE
.PP
In this way, the user can avoid lengthy type-in to the shell, and still
give
.B nmh
commands safely.  (Recall that some
.B nmh
commands
invoke others, and that in all cases, the profile is read, meaning that
aliases are disregarded beyond an initial command invocation)
