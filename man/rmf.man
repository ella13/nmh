.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Rmf
removes all of the messages (files) within the specified
(or default) folder, and then removes the folder (directory) itself.
.PP
If there are any files within the folder which are not a part of
.BR nmh ,
they will
.B not
be removed, and an error will be produced.
If the folder is given explicitly or the
.B \-nointeractive
option is
given, then the folder will be removed without confirmation.  Otherwise,
the user will be asked for confirmation.  If
.B rmf
can't find the
current folder, for some reason, the folder to be removed defaults to
`+inbox' (unless overridden by user's profile entry \*(lqInbox\*(rq)
with confirmation.
.PP
If the folder being removed is a subfolder, the parent folder will become
the new current folder, and
.B rmf
will produce a message telling the
user this has happened.  This provides an easy mechanism for selecting
a set of messages, operating on the list, then removing the list and
returning to the current folder from which the list was extracted.
.PP
If
.B rmf
s used on a read\-only folder, it will delete all the
(private) sequences
(i.e.,
.RI \*(lqatr\- seq \- folder \*(rq
entries) for this folder
from your context without affecting the folder itself.
.PP
.B Rmf
irreversibly deletes messages that don't have other links, so
use it with caution.

.SH CONTEXT
.B Rmf
will set the current folder to the parent folder if a
subfolder is removed; or if the current folder is removed, it will make
\*(lqinbox\*(rq current.  Otherwise, it doesn't change the current folder
or message.

.SH BUGS
Although intuitively one would suspect that
.B rmf
works recursively,
it does not.  Hence if you have a sub\-folder within a folder, in order
to
.B rmf
the parent, you must first
.B rmf
each of the children.
