.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Conflict
is a program that checks to see if the interface between
.B nmh
and the transport system is in good shape
.PP
.B Conflict
also checks for maildrops in %mailspool% which do not
belong to a valid user.  It assumes that no user name will start with
`.', and thus ignores files in %mailspool% which begin with `.'.  It also
checks for entries in the
.BR group (5)
file which do not belong
to a valid user, and for users who do not have a valid group number.
In addition duplicate users and groups are noted.
.PP
If the
.B \-mail
.I name
switch is used, then the results will be sent
to the specified
.IR name .
Otherwise, the results are sent to the standard output.
.PP
The
.B \-search
.I directory
switch can be used to search directories
other than %mailspool% and to report anomalies in those directories.
The
.B \-search
.I directory
switch can appear more than one time in an
invocation to
.BR conflict .
.PP
.B Conflict
should be run under
.BR cron (8),
or whenever system accounting takes place.
