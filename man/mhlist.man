.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mhlist
command allows you to list information (essentially
a table of contents) about the various parts of a collection of
MIME (multi-media) messages.
.PP
.B mhlist
manipulates MIME (multi-media messages) as specified
in RFC\-2045 thru RFC\-2049 (See
.BR mhbuild (1)).
.PP
The
.B \-headers
switch indicates that a one-line banner should be
displayed above the listing.
.PP
The
.B \-realsize
switch tells
.B mhlist
to evaluate the
\*(lqnative\*(rq (decoded) format of each content prior to listing.
This provides an accurate count at the expense of a small delay.
.PP
If the
.B \-verbose
switch is present, then the listing will show
any \*(lqextra\*(rq information that is present in the message,
such as comments in the \*(lqContent-Type\*(rq header.
.PP
The option
.B \-file
.I file
directs
.B mhlist
to use the specified
file as the source message, rather than a message from a folder.
If you specify this file as \*(lq-\*(rq, then
.B mhlist
will
accept the source message on the standard input.  Note that the
file, or input from standard input should be a validly formatted
message, just like any other
.B nmh
message.  It should
.B NOT
be in mail drop format (to convert a file in mail drop format to
a folder of
.B nmh
messages, see
.BR inc (1)).
.PP
By default,
.B mhlist
will list information about the entire
message (all of its parts).  By using the
.B \-part
and
.B \-type
switches, you may limit the scope of this command to particular
subparts (of a multipart content) and/or particular content types.
.PP
A part specification consists of a series of numbers separated by dots.
For example, in a multipart content containing three parts, these
would be named as 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  If part 2 was also a
multipart content containing two parts, these would be named as 2.1 and
2.2, respectively.  Note that the
.B \-part
switch is effective for only
messages containing a multipart content.  If a message has some other
kind of content, or if the part is itself another multipart content, the
.B \-part
switch will not prevent the content from being acted upon.
.PP
A content specification consists of a content type and a subtype.
The initial list of \*(lqstandard\*(rq content types and subtypes can
be found in RFC\-2046.
.PP
A list of commonly used contents is briefly reproduced here:
.PP
.RS 5
.nf
.ta \w'application  'u
Type	Subtypes
----	--------
text	plain, enriched
multipart	mixed, alternative, digest, parallel
message	rfc822, partial, external-body
application	octet-stream, postscript
image	jpeg, gif, png
audio	basic
video	mpeg
.fi
.RE
.PP
A legal MIME message must contain a subtype specification.
.PP
To specify a content, regardless of its subtype, just use the
name of the content, e.g., \*(lqaudio\*(rq.  To specify a specific
subtype, separate the two with a slash, e.g., \*(lqaudio/basic\*(rq.
Note that regardless of the values given to the
.B \-type
switch, a
multipart content (of any subtype listed above) is always acted upon.
Further note that if the
.B \-type
switch is used, and it is desirable to
act on a message/external-body content, then the
.B \-type
switch must
be used twice: once for message/external-body and once for the content
externally referenced.
.SS "Checking the Contents"
The
.B \-check
switch tells
.B mhlist
to check each content for an
integrity checksum.  If a content has such a checksum (specified as a
Content-MD5 header field), then
.B mhlist
will attempt to verify the
integrity of the content.
